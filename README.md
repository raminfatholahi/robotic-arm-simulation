Robotic Arm Simulation
Project Description:
This project simulates a 6-DOF (degrees of freedom) robotic arm using the PyBullet physics engine. It demonstrates how to use the PyBullet library to load and control a robotic arm model, visualize it in a simulation environment, and perform basic physics-based simulations. This simulation can be used as a starting point for research in robotics, control systems, and automation.

Features:
Simulates a 6-DOF robotic arm using PyBullet.
Includes a physics engine to model gravity and collision.
Provides a real-time simulation of robotic arm movements.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
PyBullet library

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/raminfatholahi/robotic-arm-simulation.git

cd robotic-arm-simulation

Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required packages:
pip install pybullet
Running the Simulation

To run the robotic arm simulation, execute the following command:
python robotic_arm.py
This will start the PyBullet physics engine and display the robotic arm in a simulated environment.
